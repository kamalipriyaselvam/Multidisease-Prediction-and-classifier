**Multi-Disease Prediction and Classifier: A Comprehensive Approach for Healthcare Decision Support**

In the face of the ongoing pandemic and the need for remote healthcare solutions, there is a lack of accessible platforms for individuals to validate medical results, raise awareness about diseases, and access essential precautionary measures. 
Existing solutions are often complex and do not cater to the diverse needs of users. 
This project aims to develop a user-friendly platform that addresses these challenges by providing comprehensive healthcare decision support, empowering individuals to make informed choices about their health from the comfort of their homes.

Technology Stack:
Programming Language: Python
Web Framework: Flask
Cloud Platform: Heroku
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow or Py Torch (common choices for implementing CNNs)
Version Control: Git
Serialization: Pickle

Algorithms:
Random Forest Classifier: Used for disease prediction.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Deep learning algorithm particularly effective for image-based data analysis. It can be used for tasks like image classification or segmentation in medical imaging.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Employed Randomized Search CV to optimize the parameters of the Random Forest Classifier.
Data Preprocessing: Standard scaling of features, encoding categorical variables.

Methods:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilized Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for visualizing data distributions, correlations, and patterns.
Feature Selection: Investigated correlations between features and target variable to select relevant features for modelling.
Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using confusion matrix and accuracy score.
Model Deployment: Deployed the trained model using Flask web framework on Heroku server for user interaction.
